For example, <span role="img" aria-label="ok">üëå</span> is seen as "OK" in most Western countries, but is offensive in Brazil or American Sign Language.

                       This complicated what exactly we could use in our game to ensure that it would be universal. Our other alternative was to come up with gestures completely on our own, but we were worried people would not understand the gestures or their intent if we did so. In the end we focused on Western-based gestures to use in our scenario.

By playing these games we got a better sense of what was possible with the Touch controllers and to what extent we could reflect hand movement.

We then went on to trying a Western robbery, where you were a teller held at gunpoint who would be shot if you spoke. However we ran into issues of agency and the problem of talking, eventually settling back on the alien scenario, specifically in the world of Star Trek.

                        We began by drafting out a storyboard that incorporated gestures we wanted to use. The scenario was that of greeting an alien on their world, trying to give them a transponder. We also had to take into account what gestures we were going to perform, and factor them into the story.

                        Most of our gesture choices were driven by the fact that the Oculus Touch has a limited range of gestures it supports. Only the pointer and thumb fingers are supported as individual digits, the other three finders move as one block. This makes it difficult to incorporate gestures that use fingers in ways other Oculus designed, for example we could not detect Spock's famous Vulcan salute <span role="img" aria-label="live long and prosper">üññ</span>

                        When it comes to creating a VR experience, the most important thing you need to impart to your player is a sense of being. They need to feel as if they really are on another planet, or exploring a medieval empire. Because of this both character and environment design are vital to ensure this sense of immersion. I made ample use of <a href="https://sketchfab.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Sketchfab</a> to grab basic models to tweak and animate for ourselves to cut down the 3D time.

                        As for the environment, we thought that it should be a more muted environment, so that the player would be more focused on the alien in front of them instead of getting too engrossed in their surroundings. So I just created a basic landmass using Unity's terrain editor and placed our alien inside it.

                        One of the main complaints was our character design, <b>our alien felt lifeless and also difficult to engage with</b>. This was likely due the fact that our alien was helmeted and their facial features could not be seen. In order to alleviate this, I <b>took a more animalistic approach using an alien model which more resembled a domestic dog or cat in order to make it more relatable</b> to players, as well as being more expressive due to the addition of ears and a tail.

                        Despite the belief that a more muted environment would make players focus on the alien in front of them, it actually had the opposite effect. Players would quickly become disinterested in the environment, leading them to become less invested in the scenario. <b>In order to keep them engaged in our game of interacting with an alien species, we had to find a terrain sufficiently ‚Äúalien‚Äù as well.</b>

                        Our second user test provided very useful feedback on the nature of the gestures, as we identified some "problem" gestures. Pointing especially created difficulty, due to both technical detection problems and unclear environmental cues as to what the alien was pointing at. Exchanging gifts was also a pain point, as our detection was too fast so objects would teleport between the player and the alien.

                        On the plus side our testers had great things to say about the alien, using words like "patient", "kind" and "friendly." They also felt that the <b>gestural communication provided a more human touch</b> to games, rather than the typical button press, and saw it having applications in other VR experiences, like telling a teammate "Good job!" or establishing a standard gestural language.
